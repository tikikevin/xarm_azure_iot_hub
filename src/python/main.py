    Asynchronously attempts to establish a serial connection with the specified port using exponential backoff.

    This function repeatedly tries to connect to a serial port defined by the global variable `SERIAL_PORT` 
    with the baud rate specified by `BAUD_RATE`. If the connection fails, it waits for an exponentially 
    increasing delay (starting at 2 seconds, up to a maximum of 30 seconds) before retrying. The process 
    continues until a successful connection is made (i.e., `ser` is not None and is open).

    Returns:
        serial.Serial: An open serial connection object.

    Raises:
        None: All exceptions related to serial connection are handled internally with retries.

    Side Effects:
        - Modifies the global variable `ser` to hold the connected serial object.
        - Prints connection status and errors to the console.
        - Waits asynchronously between retries.
